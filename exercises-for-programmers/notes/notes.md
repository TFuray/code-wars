# Problem

Create a program that prompts for an input string and displays output that shows the input string and the number of
characters the string contains.

## Constraints

• Be sure the output contains the original string.
• Use a single output statement to construct the output.
• Use a built-in function of the programming language to
determine the length of the string.

## Challenges

• If the user enters nothing, state that the user must enter
something into the program.
• Implement this program using a graphical userinterface
and update the character counter every time a key is
pressed. If your language doesn’t have a particularly
friendly GUI library, try doing this exercise with HTML
and JavaScript instead.

## Example Output

What is the input string? Homer
Homer has 5 characters.

## Inputs Processes and Outputs

### Inputs

- String

### Processes

- calculate number of characters in string

### Outputs

- Contains original string
- Number of characters

## Pseudocode

- initialize input
- initialize count to 0

- prompt for input with "Input text to count characters

- take input and use built in function to get length
- count = input.length()

- Display "{input} has {count} characters."
